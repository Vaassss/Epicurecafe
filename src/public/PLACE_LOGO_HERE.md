# 🖼️ Logo Placement Instructions

## Quick Start

**Place your Epicure Cafe logo PNG file here:**

```
/public/epicure-logo.png
```

## Steps

1. **Locate your logo file** - Find your actual Epicure Cafe logo (PNG format)
2. **Rename it** to exactly: `epicure-logo.png` (all lowercase)
3. **Place it** in this `/public/` directory
4. **Refresh** your browser (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

## ✅ That's It!

Once you place the file, the logo will automatically appear on:
- Landing page (hero section)
- Login page (header)
- Customer dashboard (header)
- Barista dashboard (header)
- Admin dashboard (header)

## CSS & Styling

All the CSS is already configured! Your logo will:
- ✅ Display with proper brightness/contrast filters
- ✅ Be rounded (circular) on all pages
- ✅ Scale responsively for mobile/desktop
- ✅ Blend beautifully with the dark green background
- ✅ Have glow effects on the landing page

## File Requirements

- **Format:** PNG (recommended for transparency)
- **Size:** Any size (will auto-scale, but 400x400 or larger recommended)
- **Name:** Must be exactly `epicure-logo.png`
- **Location:** Must be in `/public/` directory

## Troubleshooting

If the logo doesn't appear after placing the file:

1. **Check the filename** - Must be exactly `epicure-logo.png` (lowercase, with hyphen)
2. **Check the location** - Must be in `/public/` directory, not in subfolders
3. **Hard refresh** your browser:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
4. **Clear cache** if needed
