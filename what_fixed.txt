Epicure Cafe – Fix Report (Copy-Paste)

CSS/Tailwind not applying
Root cause:
Tailwind CSS was not being processed because the Tailwind v4 PostCSS plugin wasn’t installed at the project root. The @import "tailwindcss" directive in src/styles/globals.css was not compiled.
Actions:
Added root PostCSS config:
File: /home/vaas/Desktop/suju/Epicurecafe-main/postcss.config.js
Content: export default { plugins: { '@tailwindcss/postcss': {}, }, }
Installed plugin at project root:
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
Result:
Vite now loads PostCSS and compiles Tailwind.
Styles render correctly (hero background, typography, gradients, buttons, spacing, etc.).
Optional clean-up:
To silence the “MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON” warning, either add "type": "module" to the root package.json or change the PostCSS config to CommonJS: module.exports = { plugins: { '@tailwindcss/postcss': {} } }
Demo OTP not visible in toast
Root cause:
The frontend shows the OTP in the toast only if response.otp exists. The backend /send-otp endpoint wasn’t returning the otp value, so the toast displayed “OTP sent to your phone number” without the code.
Actions:
Ensured demo mode response includes otp from backend:
File: src/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx
Endpoint: POST /make-server-6a458d4b/send-otp
Response includes: return c.json({ success: true, message: "OTP sent successfully", otp: otp // present in demo mode });
Result:
The toast now shows: “OTP sent! Demo OTP: 123456” in the bottom-right as intended.
Production note:
Before going live with Jio SMS, remove otp from the response and enable actual SMS send in the server code.
Verification steps

CSS:
Restart dev server: npm run dev
Visit http://localhost:3000
Confirm hero styles, typography, Tailwind utilities all applied.
OTP:
Navigate to Login, enter a valid 10-digit number.
Click Send OTP.
Confirm toast message shows the 6-digit OTP.
Enter OTP and proceed with verification/register flow.
Net effect

Styling issues resolved; Tailwind pipeline working.
Demo OTP is visible in the toast for testing until Jio SMS integration is ready.
